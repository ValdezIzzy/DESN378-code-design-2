/* Rationale: The primitive constraint got rid of my logo's expressive line work as well as it's fun paint like stroke pattern. Everything needed to be thick and geometric which made it uneven and slightly goofy. I used shape stacking to create negative space in order to create the smile as well as the small gap in the face which was tough to get the math right after rounding the numbers. I also used alignment to make the smile match the circle of the face. */
