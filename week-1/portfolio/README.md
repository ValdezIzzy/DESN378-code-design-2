### Token System Explanation

In created my different variables in Figma, I wanted them to have a numbered system where 0 equals the lightest or white while 100 (or 90 in most cases) was the darkest version of that color or pretty close to black. 

I made sure to add the different branding colors, following closely with the example videos, as well as including all of the primitive colors even though none of them are used since it's good to have them.

In terms of spacing and sizing variables, I did most of them completely different from others so the sizing is a bit all over the place so I set a few values and had Copilot help with the rest so that no tokens were missed.

### Design Decisions Worth Noting

While it seems like I created a simple inverse color, I tried to make visually pleasing decisions although it was difficult because some things I didn't think should change and in using the tokens, those colors shifted anyway. While I could go into it and either hardcode the color choice or create a specific variant for that color, I'm fine with leaving it for now so that it fits the requirements of the assignment and it gives me something to work on and shift later after I add other elements.

There is also an issue with the icons when the sight is in light mode which applies to the last paragraph, but that will be fixed by toggling those with white ones so they are visible later on.
