            <h2>The Threshold</h2>
            <p>The specific moment when code clicked for me was honestly the beginning. After all the confusing network talk, I was able to understand HTML all the way up through styling using CSS. The part where it went downhill was towards learning flexbox but I did understand better through doing the tutorials and playing the games.</p>

            <h2>The Pit</h2>
            <p>The thing that was the hardest for me was flexbox and a lot thereafter. I understood how to put things in a row or column but once I needed to move things around the page, it was really confusing. Doing the icons behind the different sections in the interactive field guide was probably the most troublesome experience I had coding.</p>

            <h2>The Pivot</h2>
            <p>I stuck to the plan for the majority of it. I love the grunge vibes and I had a vision for what I wanted the site to be as soon as I saw the moodboard. I kept all the colors and used the fonts listed on there since they still fit me and my vibe and I leaned into keeping the same distressed gray background, white font, and I had fun integrating the bricks with multiple hover states.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>I'm pretty happy with how I handled this course. I took a bunch of notes and tried my best to maintain as much information as I could and only use AI as a tool when I was super lost or frustrated with something. I would maybe try to utilize said notes better so my memory of the code would improve.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>This hybrid skillset will be extremely useful. Knowing how to do things and what things, such as animations, breakpoints, and hover states will greatly impact how I see digital design seeing as I will always have that in the back of my head in order to improve design choices and make things professional and fun.</p>
