## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I learned about JavaScript this week. I learned some of the tags that are used, what strings are, integers, how to link it with HTML or do script in HTML as well as other integral things in order to utililze JavaScript to its full potential. I didn't know that JS was in charge of the behavioral aspects of a site so learning how to do the alerts and change the name in the header of the browser was fun and interesting.
​
​
### What Was Hard
There wasn't anything that was too difficult, yet. I guess the part where I had to copy and paste the code from Mozilla and alter it slightly to fit my specifications was difficult because there was advanced stuff that I didn't know how to do so it took longer to learn about what it was and then using the script for my assignment. It was also hard cropping the pictures down, but once I figured out how it was fine.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I believe I used ChatGPT albeit briefly in order to understand some of the JS code that I was inputting into my assignment as well as decerning the instructions which matched but had some discrepancies which I couldn't decipher, but maybe that was a me issue.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
There is still stuff about JavaScript that I do not yet know like how to fully use it or find code that I can use and be able to alter it so it does what I want it to do. However, in terms of what I learned and it being clear or not, I feel like I am fine at this point since we are just starting so it isn't too bad yet.
