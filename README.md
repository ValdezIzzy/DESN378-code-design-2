## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

## Week 0​
### What I Learned
I learned about JavaScript this week. I learned some of the tags that are used, what strings are, integers, how to link it with HTML or do script in HTML as well as other integral things in order to utililze JavaScript to its full potential. I didn't know that JS was in charge of the behavioral aspects of a site so learning how to do the alerts and change the name in the header of the browser was fun and interesting.
​
​
### What Was Hard
There wasn't anything that was too difficult, yet. I guess the part where I had to copy and paste the code from Mozilla and alter it slightly to fit my specifications was difficult because there was advanced stuff that I didn't know how to do so it took longer to learn about what it was and then using the script for my assignment. It was also hard cropping the pictures down, but once I figured out how it was fine.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I believe I used ChatGPT albeit briefly in order to understand some of the JS code that I was inputting into my assignment as well as decerning the instructions which matched but had some discrepancies which I couldn't decipher, but maybe that was a me issue.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
There is still stuff about JavaScript that I do not yet know like how to fully use it or find code that I can use and be able to alter it so it does what I want it to do. However, in terms of what I learned and it being clear or not, I feel like I am fine at this point since we are just starting so it isn't too bad yet.

## Week 1: Systems That Respond​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
This week, I learned more about design systems. They are an overarching umbrella that holds a lot of information about the foundational design elements of a site, project, ect. It should be used because it keeps things more organized, makes it easier if you are working with a team, and makes things simplier if you want cohesion and continuity.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
I would say the JavaScript for the Storytelling assignment was difficult for me because the JS had a whole bunch of things like the if and the querySelector that I wasn't quite comfortable with using yet. I don't know when exactly to use it and I also have trouble remembering the format of JS since I have to remember the formatting for HTML and CSS as well (I guess I don't have to, but it is taking up brain space).​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
During the troubles with the Storytelling assignment, I asked ChatGPT to better explain things to me and help with changing things according to my file names which didn't match up according to the code so I had to ask what was wrong, but easily made the change using Copilot.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I would say that JS is still unclear for me at this moment because I need more practice and experience with it. I'm going to take the time and do that extra assignment to better understand the toggling using JavaScript and probably work with ChatGPT to further understand it. I wouldn't say I'm in a rough place understanding, more of a learning phase with subtle confusion but nothing I can't handle.

## Week 2: Remembering Choices​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
I feel like a lot of the learning on Figma was pretty attainable for me. I understand the concept of variables really well because of utilizing them in CSS. After going through the JavaScript stuff again, the querySelector also makes more sense and the swapping of images through a click. While I won't be able to remember exactly how to do it, I understand it and how it could be used.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
The thing that was the most frustrating for me was making variables for something I had already made. It makes more sense to start out making variables and putting them into the designs (similar to styles) but it was another thing adding it to something I already created. Making the light and dark mode work correctly was such a hassle and I realize how many varables one would actually need to make a fully fledged system to actually work.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I did not end up using it a lot this time around because it was easier for me to understand and I knew what I was doing for the most part althought the process itself was difficult. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I feel like this past week wasn't too bad in terms of comprehension, but I'm sure I'll need further practice in using variables in Figma and naming tokens in JS.

## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
<!-- Design tokens, state vs appearance, system preference, persistence -->
I learned a lot about system preferences and persistence especially when it comes to light and dark modes. I learned a lot of JavaScript and what is required in order to have a successful toggle that changes the theme as well as being able to save preferences or go into the user's system to find their personal preference. I also did a reading on SVG's which reminded me heavily of high school math which shouldn't big too big of an issue for me, but then again it is difficult to imagine placement without seeing what it looks like.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
It took a bit of time to understand the JavaScript and how the toggle works fundamentally so it was a very confusing time since it took a lot of brain power to comprehend what certain things meant such as the dataset and localStorage especially.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
I don't think I used a lot of AI, maybe a little to format my code and get things working properly but that wasn't to do it for me it was to ask about issues and I would troubleshoot it personally.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
I wouldn't say anything in particular remains unclear, maybe the matchMedia which was just introduced but after I implement it I'm sure it won't be too big of an issue. Same thing in regards to SVG's considering I haven't implemented them in anything yet.
